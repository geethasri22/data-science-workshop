# Data-Science-workshop
Over the course of three days, our Data Science workshop provided a practical introduction to the tools and techniques essential for data analysis. Below is a summary of what was covered each day.

Day 1 - Introduction to Python Libraries
We began by exploring the foundational Python libraries used in data science. These included NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis  for data visualization. Participants learned how to load datasets, perform basic statistical operations, and visualize data effectively. Jupyter Notebooks were used throughout for hands-on coding practice.

Day 2 - Data Preprocessing Techniques
The second day focused on the importance of preparing clean data for analysis. Participants learned to handle missing values using techniques like mean and mode imputation, identify and remove duplicate entries, convert data types such as strings to datetime objects, and encode categorical data using label encoding and one-hot encoding. Simple normalization methods such as min-max scaling were also introduced.
------Feature Engineering and Data Transformation
On the final day, we explored feature engineering, which involves creating new features to improve model performance. This included extracting new variables from existing data, transforming numerical features, and combining features to capture relationships. Participants also learned about scaling, binning, and applying log transformations to handle skewed data distributions.

Key Takeaways

By the end of the workshop, participants had a strong understanding of data handling using Python, the ability to clean and prepare datasets, and the skills to design meaningful features for machine learning models. The workshop provided a solid foundation for further learning in data science and machine learning.
